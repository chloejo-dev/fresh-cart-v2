## 📈 Challenges & Solutions

### Preserving Guest Cart Items

**Problem:**
Guest cart items are lost when users sign in because guest and authenticated carts are managed separately.

**Solution:**
Store guest cart items in localStorage and merge them with the user’s cart after sign-in, allowing users to continue shopping seamlessly.

---

### Preventing Open Redirects

**Problem:**
Using unvalidated redirect URLs can expose users to phishing attacks and credential theft.

**Solution:**
Implement a redirect map and allow navigation only to predefined routes.

---

### Handling Failed Order Requests

**Problem:**
The "Placing Order..." button remains disabled when order creation fails, preventing users from retrying the checkout process.

**Solution:**
Add a finally block and reset the submitting state so that users can retry the checkout process after a failed order request.
